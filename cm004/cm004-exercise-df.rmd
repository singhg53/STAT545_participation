## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## LaTeX Equations in R Markdown

Here is an equation:

$$\alpha = 5 + 2$$

Inline equation: $\alpha = 5 + 2$. 

## Data frame exploration

### Setting up

First, load the `gapminder` R package. If you don't have it installed, run `install.packages("gapminder")` in the console first.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

### What is a data frame?

It's tabular data. To get a sense of this, go ahead and print out the `gapminder` object (you might want to do this in the console!).

### Exploration of data frames

Let's explore `gapminder` with functions like `head`, `ncol`, `str`, `summary`.
head(gapminder)
str(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)

### Extracting columns/"variables"

Let's extract a column with `$`. Maybe compute its variance.

```{r}
gapminder$pop
```
